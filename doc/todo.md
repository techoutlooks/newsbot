## FIXME

* `PublishCmd`: request stats from `leeram-analytics/publishapi` 
* `PublishCmd`: do not publish with same version twice (reject minor changes, cf `newsutils.pipelines`) 
* `PublishCmd`: ensure channels are available before attempting publishing
* Docker container must run wsgi/gunicorn/asyncio, etc. instead of mere ./run.py script

## Feature request
